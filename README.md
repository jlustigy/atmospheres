A Pythonic tour through (exo)planetary atmospheres

## Notes 
Jupyter notebooks in this repo are converted to LaTeX files using the following line  
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to latex homework1.ipynb
```
If this fails you may need to update or install pandoc (I did `brew install pandoc` and it worked like a charm).
